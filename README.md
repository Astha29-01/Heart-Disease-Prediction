# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
## 📌 Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes.
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the presence of heart disease based on clinical and demographic data.

The project was developed as part of an academic Data Mining and Data Warehousing (DMDW) course, following an end-to-end data mining workflow.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze and preprocess healthcare data
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Train and compare multiple machine learning models
* Identify the best-performing model for heart disease prediction

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset contains medical attributes such as:

* Age
* Sex
* Chest pain type
* Resting blood pressure
* Cholesterol level
* Fasting blood sugar
* ECG results
* Maximum heart rate achieved
* Exercise-induced angina
* Target variable (presence of heart disease)

### 📌 Target Variable
1 → Heart disease present
0 → No heart disease

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries & Tools:

   * Pandas
   * NumPy
   * Matplotlib
   * Seaborn
   * Scikit-learn

* Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook
## 🔍 Project Workflow

* Data collection and understanding
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
   * Handling missing values
   * Removing duplicates
   * Data type validation
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature selection and preparation
* Model training
* Model evaluation and comparison
* Final prediction and result analysis

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest

## 📊 Results

* All models were evaluated using standard classification metrics.
* Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy and most consistent performance among all tested models.
* The results indicate that the dataset is well-suited for linear classification, allowing Logistic Regression to generalize better than more complex models.

 ### 📌 Key Insight:
    Certain clinical parameters such as age, chest pain type, and maximum heart rate play a significant role in prediction.

## 🏆 Best Performing Model
### ✅ Logistic Regression

* Achieved the highest accuracy based on evaluation results
* Simple, interpretable, and efficient for binary classification
* Outperformed Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and Naive Bayes on this dataset

## 🤝 Academic Context & Collaboration

This project was developed as part of the Data Mining and Data Warehousing (DMDW) course.
The work was collaboratively carried out with Yogesh Kumar, a fellow student, who contributed through discussions, experimentation, and support during model development and evaluation.
